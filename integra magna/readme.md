# ✨ Project Title

This project was created as part of an assignment.  
I gave my best effort, and although the final result was not exactly as I expected, the journey taught me a lot about frontend development concepts like responsiveness, layouts, and deployment.

## 📖 About the Project  
- Built using **HTML, CSS (and optionally JS)**.  
- Focused on creating a responsive design.  
- Learned how to structure code properly and style elements with modern CSS.  
- Explored deployment process using platforms like **Netlify / GitHub Pages**.

## 💡 What I Learned  
During this assignment, I improved in:  
- Writing cleaner and structured HTML & CSS.  
- Using **media queries** and responsive units (`clamp()`, `%`, `vw/vh`).  
- Organizing project files for readability.  
- Deploying projects live so others can access them.

## 🎯 Toughest Challenge  
The most difficult part was **making the hand image responsive**.  
- At first, the image either broke the layout or overflowed.  
- After experimenting with `object-fit`, `max-width`, and **media queries**, I made it work properly across different screen sizes.  
- This problem taught me how to think in terms of **flexible containers and relative sizing**.
